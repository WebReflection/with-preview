# with-preview

```html
<script async src="https://unpkg.com/with-preview/es.js"></script>
<img is="with-preview" src="any-image.preview.jpg">
```

Images will drop the `.preview` part of the _src_ and will fade in the non `.preview` version of the same image once loaded.

Previews can be manually generated or based on [µcompress](https://github.com/WebReflection/ucompress#readme) or [µcdn](https://github.com/WebReflection/ucdn#readme) previews.
